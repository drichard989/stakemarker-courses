# StakeMarker Courses

A derived golf-course database used by the [StakeMarker](https://stakemarker.com) app.

This dataset is **derived** from [OpenGolfAPI](https://opengolfapi.org/) — it is a
filtered, field-reduced subset containing only:

- Course name and location (city, state)
- Per-hole par values
- Per-hole stroke (handicap) index

Coordinates, contact details, architect, yardage, and other fields from the
source dataset have been removed.

## Current dataset

| | |
|---|---|
| **Courses** | 1537 |
| **Version** | 2026-05-23 |
| **Pending (initial build)** | 13069 |

A course is included only when the source API returns a complete, valid
18-hole scorecard for it. Roughly half of the upstream entries have
incomplete data and are excluded; this dataset is rebuilt incrementally
and re-fetches courses whose `updated_at` changes upstream.

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `courses.json` | Array of course records: `{ id, name, city, state, source, pars[18], hcps[18] }` |
| `courses-meta.json` | `{ version, count, total, pending }` — version is the UTC sync date |

These files are synced automatically; do not edit by hand.
